## Project Description
Our project, 'Linking Soybean Aphid Losses to Technology Investment Decisions,' is breaking new ground by developing a flexible, evidence-based framework for estimating crop losses that account for the dynamic nature of pest risks. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, we're forging a path to innovative solutions in agriculture.

## Time Period
January, 2024 to December, 2025

## Sponsoring Organization
[Minnesota Invasive Terrestrial Plants and Pests Center (MITPPC)](https://mitppc.umn.edu/), University of Minnesota 

## Activities
* **Activity 1**. Develop a regional-scale pest risk assessment approach under data-poor scenario 
* **Activity 2**. Develop a meso-scale, extensible and interoperable set of analytic workflows for crop pest risk assessment under data-rich scenario  
* **Activity 3**. Informing strategic medium- to long-term R&D investment and mitigation management strategies for soybean aphids in Minnesota
