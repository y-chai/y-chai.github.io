Ph.D. in applied economics with 6+ years of teaching and research experience in food and agricultural production, risk management, and R&D impact assessment. I am a highly motivated and versatile data scientist with a unique interdisciplinary background. My educational journey spans from a strong foundation in biology during my undergraduate and master's degrees to the pursuit of a Ph.D. in applied economics. This diverse background has equipped me with a holistic perspective and a robust analytical skillset, which I leverage to tackle complex problems. I am proficient in using R (10+ years) and Python (4+ years) for economic and statistical modeling, in-depth data analysis, and innovative data visualization. I am a motivated self-learner with strong interests in applying big data and machine learning techniques to address multifaceted challenges.
